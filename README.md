# auto-doc
This repo only serves as a basis to learn how to automate documentation building and publishing on github pages.

It will contain a couple of dummy modules that will almost surely be useless to anyone :)

Current status: can build in the vm

Next steps: - extract from vm and push to /docs
            - set up gh-pages repo
            - push to gh-pages instead of /docs
